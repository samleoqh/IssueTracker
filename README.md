Personal development issue tracking 
Just for myself reference. 
Recording all kinds of programming issues i find during my daily work. Some are related to IDE or OS like visual studio, Qt, Linux/Win/OS etc, some others may be all kinds of problems with specific languages like c/c++, c#, python, java, etc.
